- Finish install.sh
    - Install Ansible
    - Run ansible-playbook

- Add provisioners to Terraform:
    - Bootstrap management machine
    - Copy over code (including Ansible roles!)
    - Template the Ansible inventory (see https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/template/d/file.html)
    - Copy over Ansible inventory, config, and Playbook
    - Run install.sh



Notes
-----

Terraform provisioning should run with SSH agent authentication? So as long
as the key is available in my computer, Ansible should be able to connect to
the other computers in the Amazon VPC.
